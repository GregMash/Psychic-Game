# Psychic-Game

This is a game made using javascript.

The idea is to guess which letter the computer is thinking of. 

You can type any key on the keyboard, but the computer will only think of a letter a-z.

If you guess the letter within the amount of tries, then your wins will go up by one.

If you fail to guess the correct letter, your losses will go up by one.

Every time you either guess the correct letter or run out of tries, the game will reset and 
the computer will have a new letter for you to guess.

Play as many times as you like!
